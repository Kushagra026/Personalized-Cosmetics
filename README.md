# Personalized-Cosmetics
In this project, I developed a dynamic web application using the Django framework. The app includes key pages such as home.html for input through Django Forms, result.html for displaying personalized suggestions, and an optional about.html or tips.html for additional user guidance. I implemented Djangoâ€™s powerful Views to handle backend logic and used Templates for rendering the UI. Styling was enhanced with static CSS files, creating a clean and glowing user interface. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building and connecting forms, processing user data, and rendering responsive web pages using Django.
