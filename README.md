# Personalized-Cosmetics
Built a web app using Django with pages like **home.html** (input form), **result.html** (suggestions), and optional **about/tips**. Used **Django Forms** for input, **Views** for logic, **Templates** for UI, and **static CSS** for a glowing design. Gained hands-on experience in full-stack Django development.
